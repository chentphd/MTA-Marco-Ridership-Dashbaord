# Public Transit Dashboard

This project is a real-time dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) of public transit systems in the New York Metropolitan area. The data used in this project is sourced from the [MTA Daily Ridership Data](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew/about_data).

## Project Overview

The Public Transit Dashboard is built using Power BI and integrates data from open APIs and local databases. It provides insights into various aspects of public transit, such as ridership trends, comparisons to pre-pandemic levels, and other critical metrics. The dashboard is designed to support decision-making processes for transit authorities, researchers, and the general public.

You can view the live dashboard [here](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/09a8cd45-892b-43c1-9438-25151c851bdb/7448f82624d7ad61c97c?experience=power-bi).

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: The dashboard updates in real-time to reflect the latest available data.
- **KPI Tracking**: Key performance indicators such as total ridership, percentage of pre-pandemic ridership, and more are tracked.
- **Custom Visuals**: Custom visualizations provide clear and intuitive insights into the data.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: User documentation and training materials are provided to ensure ease of use and interpretation.
