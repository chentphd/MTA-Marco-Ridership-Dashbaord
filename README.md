# Public Transit Dashboard

## Overview

The Public Transit Dashboard is a real-time visualization tool built using Power BI to display key performance indicators of public transit systems. The dashboard uses data from the [MTA Daily Ridership Data](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew/about_data) to track ridership trends, compare current ridership to pre-pandemic levels, and analyze other critical metrics.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the [MTA Daily Ridership Data](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew/about_data) provided by the New York State government. This dataset includes daily ridership information for various transit services including subways, buses, LIRR, Metro-North, Access-A-Ride, Bridges and Tunnels, and the Staten Island Railway.

## Features

- **Real-Time Dashboard**: The dashboard provides up-to-date visualizations of transit ridership data.
- **KPI Tracking**: Key performance indicators such as total estimated ridership, percentage of comparable pre-pandemic day ridership, and total traffic for bridges and tunnels.
- **Custom Visuals**: Developed custom visuals to highlight important trends and metrics.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed documentation and training materials to help end-users effectively use and interpret the dashboard.

## Installation

To set up the Public Transit Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Power BI Desktop**: Ensure that you have Power BI Desktop installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

2. **Data Source Connection**: 
    - Download the MTA Daily Ridership Data from [this link](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew/data).
    - Save the dataset as a CSV file, e.g., `mta_data.csv`.

3. **Load Data into Power BI**:
    - Open Power BI Desktop.
    - Click on `Get Data` and select `CSV`.
    - Load the `mta_data.csv` file.

4. **Build Visualizations**:
    - Use the Power BI interface to create visualizations based on the loaded data.
    - Create charts, graphs, and tables to represent the key metrics and trends.
    
5. **Publish Dashboard**:
    - Once your dashboard is ready, you can publish it to the Power BI service for access from anywhere.
    - Click on `Publish` and follow the prompts to upload your dashboard to your Power BI account.

## Usage

After publishing the dashboard, you can share it with stakeholders and end-users. The dashboard will provide insights into:

- Daily total estimated ridership for subways, buses, LIRR, Metro-North, and Staten Island Railway.
- Ridership as a percentage of comparable pre-pandemic days.
- Total scheduled trips for Access-A-Ride.
- Total traffic for Bridges and Tunnels.

## Documentation and Training

Comprehensive documentation and training materials are provided to help users navigate and utilize the dashboard effectively. This includes:

- A user guide detailing how to interact with the dashboard.
- Training sessions or video tutorials on interpreting the data visualizations.
- FAQs and troubleshooting tips.
